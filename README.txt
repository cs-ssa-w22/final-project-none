Goal of our project:
    Despite the fact that neighborhood security represents an important factor
    in individuals’ choice of housing, average rental websites do not reflect
    crime rates information, probably due to a conflict of interests with landlords.
    The main purpose of this project is to provide an aggregated rental information
    in Chicago City incorporating both rental information and past neighborhood crime
    rates in 2021 for future tenants. The final output will be an interactive map
    where users can click on geographical points to access both crime rates and
    housing features including bedroom numbers, bathroom numbers, price range,
    amenities and other features. With the aggregated information and interactive
    map, we wish to provide a user-friendly interface to facilitate future tenants’
    decision-making on housing.
